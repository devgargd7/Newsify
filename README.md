Embeddings stored in FAISS for similarity search.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Text Similarity using SBERT/FAISS for clustering.
Graph-based Approach (Connected Components) for identifying related articles.
ElasticSearch for Fast Deduplication Lookups.
3️⃣ News Summarization Service
📌 Features

Store both short and long summaries for UI display.
📥 Inputs
Clustered news stories from Deduplication Service.
📤 Outputs
Summarized news stories stored in PostgreSQL/S3.
Event published to Kafka for UI updates.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Use BART/T5/Llama for NLP Summarization.
ROUGE Score Optimization to maintain quality.
Avoid Hallucinations by enforcing source constraints.
4️⃣ Content Categorization & Tagging Service
📌 Features
Assign categories (Politics, Tech, Sports, etc.) to articles.
Extract keywords and entities (NER) from content.
Tag articles with relevant topics for better recommendations.
📥 Inputs
Structured articles from Ingestion Service.
📤 Outputs
Category, tags, and metadata stored in PostgreSQL.
Indexed in ElasticSearch for fast lookups.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Zero-shot classification models (BART, GPT-3.5 for tagging).
NER using Spacy or BERT-based models.
Use TF-IDF or TextRank for keyword extraction.
5️⃣ User Behavior Tracking Service
📌 Features
Track user interactions (clicks, reads, likes, shares, etc.).
Store user engagement data for personalization.
Publish behavioral events to Kafka for real-time analytics.
📥 Inputs
API requests from frontend (user actions).
📤 Outputs
User behavior data stored in PostgreSQL/DynamoDB.
Streamed to Kafka for training recommendation models.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Kafka Streams for real-time event processing.
GDPR Compliance (Data Retention Policies).
Feature engineering for ML-based recommendations.
6️⃣ Recommendation Engine
📌 Features
Generate personalized news feeds using hybrid recommendations.
Update recommendations in real-time based on user behavior.
A/B test different models and ranking strategies.
📥 Inputs
User interaction data from Behavior Tracking Service.
Articles and metadata from Categorization Service.
📤 Outputs
Recommended stories stored in Redis for fast serving.
Recommendations exposed via GraphQL/REST API.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Hybrid Model (Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering).
Feature Store (Feast) for efficient recommendation lookups.
FAISS/KNN for fast nearest-neighbor retrieval.
7️⃣ API Gateway (GraphQL & REST API)
📌 Features
Expose REST & GraphQL endpoints for frontend & third-party apps.
Handle request routing & load balancing.
Enforce authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth).
📥 Inputs
API requests from frontend and external consumers.
📤 Outputs
JSON responses with news summaries, recommendations, user data.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Use FastAPI or GraphQL (Apollo Server).
Rate-limiting & API Caching (Redis, CloudFront).
OAuth for secure access to user data.
8️⃣ Bias Detection & Fairness Monitoring
📌 Features
Analyze recommendations for source diversity.
Detect overexposure to specific opinions or topics.
Introduce counter-balancing recommendations if bias is detected.
📥 Inputs
Recommendation logs from Recommendation Engine.
📤 Outputs
Bias scores stored in PostgreSQL for monitoring.
Reports and insights accessible via API.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Sentiment analysis on recommended articles.
Use SHAP/LIME for explainable AI in recommendations.
Diversity Score Calculation (Measuring source/topic spread).
9️⃣ Performance Monitoring & Analytics
📌 Features
Track system performance metrics (latency, API errors, model drift).
Monitor ML pipeline health (data drift, model accuracy).
Provide real-time dashboards for analytics.
📥 Inputs
Logs & events from all microservices.
📤 Outputs
Metrics stored in Prometheus/Grafana for visualization.
🛠 Useful Development Considerations
Prometheus for system metrics collection.
Grafana Dashboards for real-time visualization.
Alerting & Notifications (PagerDuty, Slack, Email).

Service Discovery:
For early development & POCs: Keep using API Gateway-Based Discovery.
For production deployments: Use Kubernetes DNS-based Service Discovery.
For non-Kubernetes environments: Use Consul or Eureka for automated service registration.
